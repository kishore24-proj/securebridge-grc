# Phase 2 – Risk Management

##  Purpose of This Folder
This folder contains all documentation, templates, and tools required to execute the **Risk Management** phase of the SecureBridge-GRC framework.  
It supports ISO 27001 compliance by helping the organization identify, assess, treat, and monitor risks to its information assets.

Anyone reviewing this folder should expect to find:
- A structured approach to risk management
- A current and complete Risk Register
- Templates for consistent risk assessments
- A documented Risk Treatment Plan
- A Statement of Applicability (SoA) mapping Annex A controls to implementation status

##  Objectives
- Establish a repeatable risk management process
- Prioritize risks based on likelihood and impact
- Define treatment strategies and link them to controls
- Maintain audit-ready documentation for internal and external review

##  Folder Structure
- `risk-register.xlsx` – Master list of identified risks with scoring and treatment status
- `risk-assessment-template.md` – Template for documenting individual risk assessments
- `risk-treatment-plan.md` – Summary of mitigation strategies and control mapping
- `statement-of-applicability.md` – Annex A control mapping with implementation status
- `archive/previous-assessments/` – Historical risk assessments for audit trail

##  Methodology
We follow a qualitative risk assessment approach:
1. **Identify** risks to assets, processes, and stakeholders
2. **Assess** likelihood and impact using predefined scales
3. **Evaluate** risk level and determine treatment strategy
4. **Treat** risks via mitigation, transfer, acceptance, or avoidance
5. **Monitor** and review risks regularly

##  Maintenance
- Risk Register should be reviewed monthly or after major changes
- Treatment plans must be updated as controls evolve
- SoA must reflect the current implementation status of Annex A controls
