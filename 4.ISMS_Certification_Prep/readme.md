# Phase 4: ISMS Certification Prep – README

Welcome to **Phase 4** of SecureBridge‑GRC’s ISO 27001 implementation journey.  
This phase is all about shifting from building and refining the ISMS to proving it — ensuring we’re audit‑ready, confident, and organized for certification.

## Purpose

- Ensure all ISO 27001 requirements are fully implemented and documented  
- Consolidate evidence of control effectiveness and compliance  
- Prepare staff, systems, and leadership for external auditor engagement  
- Identify and close any gaps before certification day

##  Deliverables in This Phase

1. **`certification-prep-checklist.md`** – Master list to verify readiness  
2. **`mock-audit-plan.md`** – Simulation of the certification audit to identify gaps early  
3. **`staff-prep-guide.md`** – Briefing for team members on their role during the audit  
4. **`audit-day-logistics.md`** – Schedule, points of contact, and resource arrangements  
5. **`evidence-index.md`** – Mapped references to all required documents and records
