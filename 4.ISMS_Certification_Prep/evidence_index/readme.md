#  Evidence Index – ISO 27001 Certification Audit

This index maps all required evidence for SecureBridge‑GRC’s certification audit to its source location.  
It ensures rapid retrieval during auditor requests and prevents oversight.

##  Maintenance Notes

- Audit this index **monthly** in the 3 months leading up to certification  
- Ensure all evidence links open and all files are final‑approved versions  
- Archive outdated versions separately — only current versions should be in scope  
- Link major improvements or changes back to this index for traceability

> **Tip:** Assign an “Evidence Marshal” on audit day to sit with the auditors and retrieve documents from this index on demand — it speeds up the process and keeps control over what’s shared.
