- Listen carefully to each question before answering  
- Speak truthfully and based on your actual work practices  
- Show evidence when requested — documents, logs, records  
- Ask for clarification if a question is unclear  
- Be polite, professional, and concise

**Avoid:**
- Guessing or speculating

## Common Auditor Questions

- “Can you explain how you perform [specific process]?”  
- “Where is this process documented?”  
- “How do you know if a control is working effectively?”  
- “What would you do if you discovered a security incident?”  
- “How have you been trained for your role?”

## Pro Tips

- If you don’t know an answer, say:  
  *“I’m not certain, but I can connect you with the right person or locate the document.”*  
- Keep answers aligned with documented procedures — **practice consistency**  
- Remember: auditors are assessing the system, not your personal performance

---

##  After the Audit

- Share any auditor feedback with your manager or the Certification Lead  
- Support corrective actions if findings relate to your area  
- Keep improving — certification is the starting line, not the finish

> **Note:** This guide should be issued to all audit participants at least 2 weeks before audit day, with a Q&A session scheduled to address staff concerns.
