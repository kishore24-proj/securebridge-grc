# Vendor Security Policy

## 1. Purpose
To define how SecureBridge‑GRC evaluates, engages, and monitors third‑party vendors so they meet or exceed the security controls outlined in our core policy suite.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all current and prospective vendors, suppliers, and service providers that process, store, transmit, or have access to SecureBridge‑GRC data, systems, or facilities.

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1 Alignment with Core Policies
- All vendors must agree in writing to comply with SecureBridge‑GRC’s Information Security, Acceptable Use, Access Control, Data Classification, Incident Response, Encryption, and Backup & Retention policies where applicable.

### 3.2 Due Diligence & Onboarding
- Vendors undergo a documented security risk assessment before engagement.
- High‑impact vendors must provide evidence of security certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2) or pass a questionnaire.
- Contracts must include security requirements, confidentiality clauses, and the right to audit.

### 3.3 Ongoing Monitoring
- Vendor risk posture is reviewed at least annually.
- Changes in a vendor’s ownership, services, or infrastructure must trigger a reassessment.
- Security incidents involving vendors must be reported to SecureBridge‑GRC within 24 hours.

### 3.4 Offboarding
- Terminated vendors must return or securely destroy all SecureBridge‑GRC data within agreed timelines.
- Access credentials are revoked immediately upon contract termination.

## 4. Exceptions
Any deviation from this policy must be approved in writing by the CISO, with documented risk acceptance.

This policy is reviewed annually or following a significant change in vendor risk management requirements.
