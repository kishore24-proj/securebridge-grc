# Access Control Policy

## 1. Purpose
To define the rules and processes for granting, managing, and revoking access to SecureBridge‑GRC’s information systems, applications, and physical facilities in a way that minimizes risk and maintains compliance.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and third parties who require access to company resources.

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1 Access Management
- Access is granted on the principle of **least privilege** — only what is necessary to perform assigned duties.
- All access requests must be approved by the appropriate manager and documented.

### 3.2 User Identification & Authentication
- Each user must have a unique user ID; shared accounts are prohibited unless explicitly approved for operational needs.
- Multi‑factor authentication (MFA) is required for remote and privileged access.
- Passwords must meet company complexity and rotation requirements.

### 3.3 Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Access rights are assigned based on job roles and responsibilities.
- Role definitions and associated permissions must be reviewed and updated at least annually.

### 3.4 Privileged Accounts
- Administrative and other high‑privilege accounts must be used only for tasks requiring such access.
- Privileged account use must be logged and monitored.

### 3.5 Access Reviews
- Managers must review user access rights at least quarterly.
- Immediate revocation is required when an employee’s role changes or they leave the organization.

### 3.6 Physical Access
- Facilities housing sensitive systems must be protected by access controls such as badges, biometrics, or security personnel.
- Visitor access must be logged and escorted.

## 4. Exceptions
Any deviations from this policy require written approval from the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and documentation of compensating controls.

## 5. Review & Maintenance
