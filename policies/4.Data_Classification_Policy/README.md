# Data Classification Policy

## 1. Purpose
To establish a standardized system for classifying and protecting SecureBridge‑GRC information assets according to their sensitivity, value, and legal/regulatory requirements.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all data created, received, maintained, or transmitted by SecureBridge‑GRC in any format (electronic, physical, verbal).

## 3. Classification Levels

| Level             | Description | Examples | Handling Requirements |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|-----------------------|
| **Public**        | Information approved for release without restriction. | Published marketing materials, press releases. | No restrictions; may be freely distributed. |
| **Internal**      | Non‑public information for general business use. | Internal memos, project plans. | Share only within the company; store on internal systems. |
| **Confidential**  | Sensitive business or personal information requiring protection. | Customer data, contracts, financial records. | Access on a need‑to‑know basis; encrypt in transit and at rest; dispose via secure methods. |
| **Restricted**    | Highest‑sensitivity information with legal, regulatory, or contractual protections. | Encryption keys, trade secrets, regulated PII/PHI. | Strict access control; MFA required; store in approved secure systems only. |

## 4. Labeling Requirements
- Electronic documents must include classification in the header, footer, or metadata.
- Physical documents must be marked with the classification level on each page.
- Email subject lines should include the classification when sending sensitive information.

## 5. Handling & Transmission
- Use company‑approved encryption for transmitting **Confidential** or **Restricted** data.
- Do not transmit **Restricted** data via personal devices or unapproved channels.
- Physical copies of sensitive data must be stored in locked cabinets when not in use.

## 6. Review & Downgrading
- Data owners may review and reclassify information as sensitivity changes.
- All reclassification actions must be documented.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions require written approval from the CISO, with documented justification and compensating controls.

## 8. Review Cycle
This policy will be reviewed annually or when legal, regulatory, or operational changes occur.
