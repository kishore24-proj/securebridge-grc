- Conduct targeted internal audits focusing on recent changes or issues  
- Brief staff on any new procedures or control updates  
- Close outstanding corrective actions from prior audits

---

##  Notes

- External auditor availability should be confirmed at least **3 months** in advance  
- Adjust timelines if certification date changes  
- Preparation phases should include a **mini‑mock audit** to validate readiness  
- Keep records from all surveillance audits in the **audit history archive** for reference

> **Tip:** Treat surveillance audits as opportunities to show improvement since the last review — auditors will expect to see evidence of progress, not just maintenance.
