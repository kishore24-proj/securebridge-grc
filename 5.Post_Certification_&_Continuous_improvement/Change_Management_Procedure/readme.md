2. **Impact & Risk Assessment**  
   - Identify affected processes, assets, and controls  
   - Assess risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability  
   - Consult relevant process owners

3. **Approval**  
   - Low‑impact changes: approved by process owner  
   - High‑impact changes: approved by ISMS Steering Committee or senior management

4. **Planning & Implementation**  
   - Define steps, resources, and rollback plan  
   - Schedule implementation to minimize disruption

5. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Validate changes in a test or controlled environment where possible  
   - Document test results

6. **Communication**  
   - Notify all affected personnel of changes and provide training if required

- Keep all change records for **at least 3 years**  
- Link significant changes back to the risk assessment and Statement of Applicability

> **Tip:** Tie every major change to a risk assessment update — it proves to auditors that you’re not just controlling changes, you’re managing risk.
